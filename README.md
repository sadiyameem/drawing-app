# Drawing-App

# Description
This is a web-based drawing app where it allows you to draw freely on a canvas.
Users can use multiple colors, adjust brush/eraser size, and clear the canvas.
This project uses HTML, CSS (inside the HTML), JavaScript and HTML canvas.

# Features
- Multiple colors
- Brush/Eraser size
- sidebar
- Buttons (clear & eraser)

# Motivation
I made this project because based on the comments I got for my other projects it said to try something new and I never used canvas before so this proejct was a great way to learn.

# Chanlleges/Learned
A challenge was to make the sidebar appear/work. I learned how to use HTML Canvas in a fun way.
